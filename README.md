Türkiye İş Bankası Branch Finder: [Yol Göster](https://berkaysenkoylu.github.io/bank_finder/)

- Backend: Node.js (deployed on Heroku)
- Database: MongoDB
- Frontend: React
- CSS Preprocessor: Sass 

Data was obtained with the utilization of Python's Beautiful Soup.

Note: Since the backend of this app is on heroku (free dyno) and apps tend to go to sleep if they have no traffic in the last 1 hour; your first http request can take around ~10secs.

Note 2: Since React's BrowserRouter doesn't work on github pages, I had to use HashRouter. It results in ugly urls, but it works.
